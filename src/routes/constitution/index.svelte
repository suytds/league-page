<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">ANNUAL ROOKIE DRAFT</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annual rookie draft will be completed in July or August.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Draft order for subsequent seasons will be determined as follows:</p>
<p>Pick 1- 12th Place Regular Season Standing</p>
<p>Pick 2- 11th Place Regular Season Standing</p>
<p>Pick 3- 10th Place Regular Season Standing</p>
<p>Pick 4- 9th Place Regular Season Standing</p>

<p>Pick 10- 3rd Place Playoff Bracket Results</p>
<p>Pick 11- 2nd Place Playoff Bracket Results</p>
<p>Pick 12- 1st Place Playoff Bracket Results</p>
<p><br>On Sleeper, you can always draft over the roster limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an owner has three open spots on your bench heading into the rookie draft, but they have 5 picks, they can still draft 5 players, but will just have to cut down to meet the roster limit before Week 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sleeper leagues do not require rosters to be under the league limit prior to a trade or a draft completing (See STARTING LINEUPS AND ROSTERS for more information.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rosters will be increased from&nbsp;25 and 3 taxi slots to 30&nbsp;and 3 taxi slots between the draft and Week 1 of the NFL season.</p>

<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">TAXI (PRACTICE SQUAD) AND INJURED RESERVE</p>
<p class="title">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle">Taxi Roster Slots</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To increase the number of viable veterans in the waivers/free agent pool, to encourage long term team planning, to increase league parity and competition. </p>
<p>Each manager will have 5 available Taxi Roster Slots to house rookies and sophomores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only players eligible for the Taxi Squad are rookies(1st year) and sophomores(2nd year).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">Injured Reserve</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each owner will have 2 Injured Reserve Slots. Players indicated as OUT,</p>
<p>SUSPENDED or IR are eligible for Injured Reserve. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">FREE AGENT ACQUISITION BUDGET (FAAB)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Free Agent Acquisition Budget system (also known as a FAAB) allocates a budget of fake "money" to each team before the season for them to spend on free agent players on waivers. Waiver claims are awarded to the highest bidder instead of the worst-ranked team. If there is a tie, the player will be awarded to the team with the worst rank. Each time a claim is processed, the bid amount is deducted from the remaining budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teams will be allocated an FAAB in alignment with their finish position in the previous year:</p>
<p>1st -$910</p>
<p>2nd -$920</p>
<p>3rd -$930</p>
<p>4th -$940</p>
<p>5th -$950</p>
<p>6th -$960</p>
<p>7th -$970</p>
<p>8th -$980</p>
<p>9th -$990</p>
<p>10th -$1,000</p>
<p>11th -$1,000</p>
<p>12th -$1,000</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FAAB budget is a tradable asset.</p>
<p>-Team X could trade Player A and $50 for Player B</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FAAB budget is a restricted saveable asset.</p>
<p>-A team can rollover 25% of their unused FAAB to the following season.</p>
<p>-A team can begin the season with a max of $1,250.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example :</p>
<p>Team A team came in last place and receives $1,000 to begin the season</p>
<p>Team A uses $800 of their budget, leaving $200.</p>
<p>25% of $200 is rolled over to next year. </p>
<p>Team A finishes in 5th place.</p>
<p>The next year, Team A will begin the season with $950 for a 5th place finish, in addition to the rolled $50 for a total of $1,000.</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">TEAMS, DIVISIONS &amp; OWNERSHIP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The League will consist of 12 teams in 2 divisions. Each team will play every team in their own division twice and play three teams in the other division once for a total of 13 regular season games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the yearly draft, the first and second place teams from the previous year will draft divisions.</p>
<p>If an owner should choose not to return, the Commissioner will find a replacement owner using whatever means necessary to keep the league stable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">DUES</p>
<p>League dues are $50&nbsp;per season per team and are non-refundable.</p>
<p>An owner may not participate in any draft until they are paid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the owner has traded away future picks beyond next season, 100% of those dues (for that advanced season) must be paid before the owner can participate in any draft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, at startup, for 2021 picks dues will already be paid. If a team wishes to trade away 2022 picks, they must pay 2022 dues. Dues must be paid by the league deadline, typically the day of the draft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an owner leaves the league for any reason, his dues are forfeited to the prize pool and he will have no claim to them in any way. This includes if he finds a replacement owner, unless the replacement owner is willing to reimburse him and pay the dues required to join the league.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an owner cannot reasonably meet the dues deadline, they must notify the Commissioner and make alternate arrangements. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of their team for the current season and seeking a replacement owner. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t be that guy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">PAYOUTS</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The payout structure is based on dues of a&nbsp;$50&nbsp;per team per season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current Year</p>
<p>Full Season (21-22)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st place - $300</p>
<p>2nd place - $150</p>
<p>3rd place - $50</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weekly prizes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will have 10 categories. These will be decided year to year. The player who played the best player in the category would win a $10 prize for the week. We will be open to suggestions for categories. Ex: Have a kicker who outscores a position player like a quarterback.</p>

<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">STARTING LINEUP &amp; ROSTERS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>League rosters will consist of no more than&nbsp;25 players during a season.</p>
<p>Rosters will be increased from 25 and 3 taxi slots to 30 and 3 taxi slots between the draft and Week 1 of the NFL season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teams are required to submit a full starting lineup each regular season week during the regular season and, if applicable, each playoff week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A starting lineup shall consist of 9 players:</p>
<p>• 1 Quarterback (QB)</p>
<p>• 2 Running Back (RB)</p>
<p>• 2 Wide Receivers (WR)</p>
<p>• 1 Tight End (TE)</p>
<p>• 1 Flex (RB/WR/TE)</p>
<p>• 1 Kicker (K)</p>
<p>• 1 Defense (DEF)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Player positions are determined by the Sleeper site. No additional restrictions are currently in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners should be aware that Sleeper may change a player’s position at any time pursuant to that player’s NFL team changing their position, e.g switching a player who was previously a tight end (TE) that of a quarter back (QB). These changes shall not be overruled by the League under any circumstances. These changes become effective when they are made by Sleeper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners are responsible for assessing the possibility that a given player may change positions before acquiring the player.</p>
<p>Players are not locked into a team’s starting lineup until the game in which the player is participating has kicked off, at which point they may not be removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners who know they will be unavailable to set their team’s lineup &nbsp;shall use their best efforts to inform the Commissioner and designate the Commissioner to set or change their team’s lineup. Should a lineup not</p>
<p>be set by a team, barring extreme circumstances, too bad, deal with it. In this case, the Commissioner &nbsp;reserves the right to submit an alternate competitive lineup if deemed necessary in order to maintain league integrity (ie: no team starting 5 injured players will be allowed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each manager will have 5 available Taxi Squad Roster Slots and 2 Injured Reserve Slots</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lazy Enforcement</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners can always draft or trade over the roster limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an owner has three open spots on their bench heading into the rookie draft, but has 5 picks, they can still draft 5 players, but will have to cut down to meet the roster limit before Week 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Team owners who are over the limit will see an image like this at the top of their team page:</p>

<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">SCORING</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scoring is based off of the Sleeper scoring system. If needed, scoring can be adjusted by a majority vote, at which point the scoring will be changed by the Commissioner in the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If scoring is changed mid season, outcomes from previous weeks that have been completed can not be changed.</p>

<p>Playoffs will take place during Weeks 14-16 of the NFL season. The winners of each division automatically make the playoffs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bye week goes to the 2 division winners with the best record, based on Overall Record &gt; Points For &gt; Points Against.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any remaining playoff slots are filled by teams that did not win the division, and</p>

<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">TRADES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trading is the lifeblood of a dynasty league. Limits on trading shall be rare, and when in doubt, a trade will be allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trading is only permitted by teams who are paid in full for the current season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A team may only trade away draft picks for future seasons for which they have paid in full.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trades are not allowed during the period shown in the league calendar (past the week&nbsp;11 deadline and the league playoffs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a trade has been proposed and accepted via the site, it cannot be rescinded except for owner error. If a trade was offered or accepted in error, the owner making the error must notify the Commissioner and the owner of the other team immediately (i.e. within 5 minutes of the trade's acceptance) to request that the trade be voided. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trades will only be revoked because of legitimate owner error that is reported in a timely manner; owners may not request that a trade be voided due to buyer’s remorse, seller’s remorse or failure to perform due diligence before proposing or accepting a trade. The Commissioner reserves the right to allow a trade to stand if an owner's claim of error is not deemed to be credible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional trades involving players or draft picks are permitted, but must be</p>
<p>documented in Sleeper. However, teams may not engage in “delayed” or “two part” trades where players are agreed to be traded but one or more players is withheld from being traded for one week or more. The Commissioner may retroactively void a trade if there is clear and convincing evidence that the trade in question was part of such a trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teams may not impose "post-trade conditions" where a team trades a player subject to a requirement that the other team perform or refrain from performing a specified action relating to the player after the trade is completed, but conditional trades based on future team record, finish in the standings, or player performance are allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: An owner may not trade a player with the condition that the player be waived immediately, or that the player must not be subsequently traded to a particular team, or that the player is benched when playing the team currently trading the player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teams may not make offseason trades unless they have paid their league fees for the upcoming season. Trades will not be processed unless all owners involved in the transaction have paid league fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners shall use their best efforts to respond promptly (within 24 hours) to trade offers from other owners. Owners are encouraged to check for trade offers every time they look at their phone, and owners should immediately reject a trade they deem unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commissioner may, under rare circumstances, decide that a trade is</p>
<p>either anti-competitive, or not in the best long-term interest of the league. In this case, the Commissioner must decide to disallow the trade. The rationale for this</p>
<p>trade veto will be documented by the Commissioner. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally, rapidly changing information is not available to both sides of a trade, particularly when the trade was opened before the news was known. In this case, it is recommended that both sides of the trade inform each other of the material information that has changed before acting on the trade. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While trading on rapidly changing information can benefit an owner short-term, it’s a bush-league move and that owner will surely be shunned and mocked and no one will want to trade with them.</p>

<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">OFFICIAL STATISTICS AND SCORING CHANGE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every week after all NFL games are played and all fantasy scores are calculated, the Elias Sports Bureau reviews all NFL games for the purposes of locating and calculating any necessary corrections to the official team and player statistics compiled during each game. These corrections will be applied to league scores when they are released by Elias and the NFL, which is usually on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners should be aware that the outcome of a game that was tied or won by a small margin may change after the Elias Sports Bureau’s scoring corrections are applied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sleeper will apply the official scoring corrections without exception, and owners</p>
<p>may not appeal the changed scoring, the changed outcome of a game, or request that the official scoring corrections be disregarded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">ORPHAN TEAMS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An owner may retire from the league in good standing. Retirement must be announced before the conclusion of Week 17 of the NFL season to retire in good standing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon announcement of an owner’s retirement, a replacement owner will be sought and they will be responsible for the upcoming season’s league fee if it has not already been paid by the retiring owner. Once an owner announces their retirement, they may not make any trades for the remainder of the season. A retirement announcement is irrevocable, but an owner who retires in good standing may be considered for reinstatement to the league after an absence of at least one full season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from retirement, orphan teams can be created through the following</p>
<p>circumstances:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Quitting owner: If an owner publicly declares they are quitting the league via Facebook , the team is immediately classified as an orphan team and the Commissioner will assume control of the team until a replacement owner is found. Quitting owners are permanently barred from seeking reinstatement to the league.</li>
<li>Abandoning owner: A team is considered abandoned during the season if an owner fails to set a lineup for two consecutive games.</li>
<li>Removal of an owner for failure to pay league fees by one month before the NFL draft.</li>
<li>Removal of an owner for cheating or anti-competitive conduct</li>
<li>Removal of an owner or multiple owners for collusion between teams</li>
<li>Removal of an owner or owners for offering and/or accepting bribes (i.e. real-life money or any other real-life consideration) as an incentive to complete league trades, league transactions or influence league activity of any kind.</li>
<li>Removal of an owner for repeated failure to return league messages and trade offers in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Removal of an owner for conduct or transactions detrimental to the league.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Removal of an owner for failing to maintain the minimum or maximum roster size.</li>
<li>Removal of an owner for repeated failure to adhere to league rules or abide by Commissioner rulings.</li>
<li>Removal of an owner by unanimous vote from league mates because owner is a douche and not wanted in the league anymore</li>
<li>Removal of an owner for repeated failure to communicate with owners or the Commissioner in a mature or respectful manner.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a team is orphaned during the season, the Commissioner will set that</p>
<p>team’s roster for the remainder of that season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Payouts won by a team orphaned during a regular season will be put into the following year’s pool to be distributed as extra prize winnings.</p>

<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">CHANGING LEAGUE RULES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposed rules or scoring changes must be communicated to all owners. This may be achieved by posting in the official league channel(Facebook).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For binary votes: 8 of 12 owners voting in favor the change will result in a successful change.</p>
<p>For votes with more than one option: If no majority is achieved, the option with the most votes will succeed. If no option receives the single most votes, the proposal will fail. The proposer will be given one additional opportunity to submit a variation of this rule change in this calendar year in order to achieve the required number of votes.</p>
<p>Changes will be implemented in the following league year unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">OWNER RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preparation is the key to short-term survival and long-term success in a dynasty</p>
<p>league. Owners are expected to be prepared for the annual drafts and to monitor NFL activities throughout the regular season and offseason, including but not limited to up-to-date knowledge of player injuries and which players and coaches have changed teams or retired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participation is the lifeblood of this league, even more than rivalries, free agents,</p>
<p>statistics or drafts. Maintaining a sense of community and respect among owners is vital to the league's long-term survival and owners’ long-term enjoyment. Posting memes , trash talking, and providing content is encouraged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the above, owners are also required to adhere to the following</p>
<p>responsibilities on behalf of their teams. An owner who fails to adhere to one or more of these responsibilities will be subject to Commissioner's sanctions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Owners are responsible for ensuring their team has current lineups</li>
<li>Owners are responsible for knowing and following the rules and schedule listed in these bylaws as well as on the League Site.</li>
<li>Owners are responsible for responding to emails or private messages from the Commissioner and other owners in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Owners are responsible for taking part in league votes and debates.</li>
<li>Owners are responsible for regularly accessing the league's app/site.</li>
<li>Owners are responsible for responding to trade offers in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Owners are responsible for participating in all required league functions and scheduled events, whether they occur in the regular season or offseason.</li>
<li>Owners are responsible for submitting weekly lineups.</li>
<li>Owners are responsible for notifying the Commissioner if they will be away for an excessive period of time so arrangements can be made to set lineups and/or manage the team during that owner’s absence.</li>
</ul>

<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-competitive conduct is defined as owners or teams engaging in conduct that prevents, reduces or otherwise negatively affects the natural competition and well-being of the league. The following anticompetitive actions are strictly prohibited. Violations of these rules shall be considered by the Commissioner and may subject an owner or owners to sanctions, which may include immediate removal from the league:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tanking:<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Owners are expected to use their best efforts to set their best available lineup every week of competition, even if they are well out of playoff contention. </span></p>
<p>Tanking is defined as failing to submit their best available starting lineup either intentionally or through indifference. It is understood that owners may play hunches on who to start and won’t always start the player who scores the most points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, an owner who knowingly benches star players or obvious starting players in favor of players who are marginal, clearly injured, benched, suspended or on their bye weeks shall be subject to Commissioner's sanctions for a first offense. A second offense shall result in that owner’s immediate removal from the league.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-competitive Trades<span style="font-weight: 400;">: Owners may not make trades that result in worsening their own team in order to stock another team playing a third team they want or need to lose. Owners may not make trades if they do not intend to return to the league for the next season. If an owner does not intend to return to the league, they should announce their retirement publicly and play out the season using their best efforts; the incoming replacement owner should be permitted to inherit an intact team and make their own trades and roster decisions. The Commissioner may retroactively void a trade if there is clear and convincing evidence that the trade was prohibited on anti-competitive grounds that were not apparent at the time of the trade.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collusion: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Collusion is defined as two or more owners making arrangements and/or acting in concert to influence the results of league activities such as game outcomes, draft standing or player availability. Any unsportsmanlike conduct coordinated between two or more owners is considered to be collusion, as is teams trading to consolidate better players on one team and/or agreeing to share payouts by acting in concert. Trading a player with the condition that he be traded back would be considered collusion, and against the rules. Owners engaging in collusion are subject to penalties and/or immediate removal from the league.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dumping:<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;An owner who, without good reason, cuts players from their team who are obviously valuable is subject to Commissioner's sanctions. If an owner continues to dump players after sanctions are imposed, the owner shall be removed from the league. It is understood that teams can and will drop “borderline” players from their rosters, but dropping obvious fantasy starters or large amounts of average players in an attempt to increase draft position, make players available to others by way of collusion or sabotage the integrity of the league shall not be tolerated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indifference<span style="font-weight: 400;">: An owner who fails to submit a starting lineup or fails to replace inactive players who are injured, benched, suspended or on their bye week is subject to Commissioner’s sanctions for a first offense. An owner who fails to set a starting lineup due to indifference twice in the same season is subject to removal from the league.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commissioner will be the final authority on all sanctions only to be</p>
<p>overturned by a unanimous vote by all other owners on a league wide poll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title" style="text-align: center;">COMMISSIONER SANCTIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If at any time an owner violates league rules or engages in conduct judged by the Commissioner as detrimental to the league in any way, the Commissioner</p>
<p>has both the authority and obligation to act to protect the league and to act</p>
<p>in its best interests. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commissioner may impose sanctions against an owner or team found to have violated league rules or conducted themselves in a manner detrimental to the league. The Commissioner is subject to the same penalties as the rest of the league. It is expected that use of Commissioner’s sanctions will be rare,appropriate to the offense, proportionate to its severity, and not undertaken lightly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commissioner's sanctions include but are not limited to the following:</p>

<ul><li>Public warning</li>
<li>Deductions from overall and divisional point totals</li>
<li>Retroactive cancellation of trades, with the possibility of forfeits declared for any games affected by the cancelled trade</li>
<li>Suspension of waiver rights for a specified period</li>
<li>Suspension of trading rights for a specified period</li>
<li>Suspension or benching of players for a specified period</li>
<li>Suspension of chat room privileges for a specified period</li>
<li>Suspension of an owner or co-owners for a specified period, with their team forfeiting all games occurring during the suspension</li>
<li>Forced waiving of players</li>
<li>Loss of future draft picks</li>
<li>Loss of Waiver Priority</li>
<li>Removal of an owner from the league</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any combination of the above sanctions deemed appropriate by the Commissioner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commissioner may impose and enforce sanctions at any time, including retroactively. The Commissioner may use an owner’s past record</p>
<p>in considering the length or severity of sanctions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commissioner will act in good faith and at all times in the best interest of the</p>
<p>league to maintain a fun, fair, competitive environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commissioner will have the final authority over all actions, activities,</p>
<p>votes, rule changes, and any other thing necessary to effectively run a good league while respecting the rights of its owners. In the rare instance that a situation arises which is not covered by the bylaws, the Commissioner reserves the right to rule on the issue in the best interest of the league. This includes times when a rule is not explicitly stated (such as a tiebreaker) but must be ruled on to move league business forward. Commissioner Committee rulings are final, binding and cannot be appealed. The intent of this clause is not to grant arbitrary, unchecked Roger Goodell-like power, but rather to empower and require the Commissioner via these bylaws to take fair and necessary executive action for the good of the league.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The league shall be governed by a Commissioner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The role of the Commissioner Committee is to:</p>

<ul><li>Maintain league logistics</li>
<li>Help set lineups and perform team/roster moves for owners if requested</li>
<li>Ensure that the league calendar is updated and followed</li>
<li>Facilitate drafts</li>
<li>Collect league dues and facilitate payouts</li>
<li>Ensure that actions that require dues to be paid are completed only if dues are up to date</li>
<li>Ensure that the league dues are paid and accounts are kept current</li>
<li>Ensure that the league website, message boards, and team pages are maintained</li>
<li>Apply penalties for owner misconduct, rules violations, or actions against the league as voted on by the league.</li>
<li>Void trades if rules are clearly violated (tradebacks, roster limits, etc.)</li>
<li>Control abandoned or otherwise orphaned franchises and seek new ownership</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the uncertainty of games being cancelled due to covid, temporary modifications are allowed to move a player into a managers lineup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to facilitate this a manager must declare their replacement player on the appropriate thread on the facebook page.</p>
<p>If a manager has a player who doesn't play due to a last minute covid change, a manager can designate a backup by Sunday morning.</p>
<p>If player 1 doesn't play, we will take player 2's points and apply it to that position.</p>
<p>You must have the backup player on your roster, and you have to have the backup designated by 10am Sunday mornings.</p>
<p>The Commissioner will make a post each Saturday night for managers to comment their primary players and backups.</p>
